# Text-Analysis-Project
 
1. Project Overview

For this project, I utilized data source from the Project Gutenberg. Because I read about the book as well as the movie "The Great Gatsby", I want to see what are some of the most commonly used words, what is the total number of words, and the number of different words. Aside from these questions, I also want to learn if I am capable of producing some codes that could execute smoothly!

2. Implementation

In the beginning of the code, I asked python to read text file "The Great Gatsby" from Project Gutenberg, skips the header, and generates a histogram of word frequencies. Following that is several functions that helps to perform analyses, such as counting the total number of words and identifying the most common words in descending order. The code also has functions to subtract two dictionaries and select a random word from the histogram. The main() function calls these functions and prints out the desired results. 

More than often, I encounter some errors and could not figure out by myself. In cases like these, I would ask ChatGPT to help me check if there's anything wrong with the code, and it can suggests me with some solutions to solve the issue. For example, I could not have python to read the text file in the beginning, so I asked ChatGPT to help me figure out what was the issue, and it provided me with some insights!

3. Results

After conducting and running my codes, here are some interesting things I find out. For example, the total number of words in this text is 51957! The number of different words in this text is 3347. Additionally, some of the times had been mentioned in the book multiple times, such as 6:00, 5:00, and 4:30.

4. Reflection

The main goal of this assignment for me is to really figure out precisely how to use pythons to read files, modify these texts, and use functions to figure out a way to do some data analysis. It was particularly challenging in the beginning trying to figure out how to get the texts as well as latter how to execute codes learned in class successfully in a different project. It was super helpful to have the ability to use ChatGPT because it can actually helps me to solve many errors I run into. I am able to use ChatGPT to help me understand the codes, and how to modify the codes to make it run!
